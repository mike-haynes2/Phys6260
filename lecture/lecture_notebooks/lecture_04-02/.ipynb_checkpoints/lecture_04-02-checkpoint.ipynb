    "#### Ray Tracing\n",

    "- Radiation transport in 1 direction\n",
    "- In a vacuum, the intensity is a constant:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\nabla I_\\nu (\\mathbf{x},\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) $$\n",
    "- The time dependence can be perscribed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moment-based method\n",
    "\n",
    "- The richness of angular information in the intensity makes it difficult to solve\n",
    "- We can control the information by studying its moments (i.e., expanding the radiation field in to spherical harmonics)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zeroth moment (scalar):\n",
    "$$ J_\\nu = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\oint I_\\nu (\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) \\,\\mathrm{d} \\Omega $$\n",
    "i.e., the mean intensity averaged over solid angle. For an isotropic, constant radiation field, $J_\\nu = I_\\nu$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First moment (vector):\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{H}_\\nu = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\oint I_\\nu (\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\,\\mathrm{d} \\Omega $$\n",
    "This moment communicates the vector direction of the average radiation bearing.\n",

    "3. Second moment (tensor):\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{K}_\\nu = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\oint I_\\nu (\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\,\\mathrm{d} \\Omega $$\n",

    "## Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the interconnectedness of the radiation being emitted from everywhere, affecting the medium, and affecting the specific rays that you want to trace $\\implies$ assumptions are required to simplify our system. First, $s$ represents the displacement along the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radiation transfer equation uses the extinction coefficient $\\alpha_\\nu = \\frac{1}{l}$, where $l$ is the mean free path \n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity along a ray behaves as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} I_\\nu(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}, s)}{\\mathrm{d} s} = - \\alpha_\\nu (s) \\, I_\\nu(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}, s) $$\n",
