    "# Numerical approaches to Molecular Dynamics\n",
    "### Molecular Dynamics Timescales\n",
    "- Limited to femto- up to nano-second timescales\n",
    "- short timescale is needed to ensure numerical stability and accuracy while conserving energy\n",
    "- Need timestepping an order of magnitude shorter than the fastest timescales in the system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Molecular Dynamics Modeling: Assumptions\n",
    "- Atoms are treated like balls on springs, with the spring constants determined by the bond strength between the particles\n",
    "- Expressly NEGLECTS QM effects!\n",
    "- N-body simulation, but 'restricted' by the bonds between the atoms\n",
    "- Typically the operations themselves are simple / cheap, it is the stacking and time evolution that requires the computational power\n",
    "- Energy conservation is used as a metric for \"accuracy\" in these computations\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Model:\n",
    "Newton's second law\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_i = m_i \\dot{v}_i = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} V(\\sum_j x_j) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "EOM:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{q}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i} $$\n",
    "$$ \\dot{p}_i = - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential energy $V$ is given by many different effects (**Inter-Atomic and Inter-Molecular**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inter-Atomic: Pair forces, Coulomb interaction, EAM (embedded atom model), reactions\n",
    "Inter-Molecular: Bond forces, Bond angle forces, Torsional forces\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair potential example: Lennard-Jones potential (Van der Vaals forces, based on quantum effects and electron potentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U(r) = K \\epsilon \\left[ \\right(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\left)^n - \\right(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\left)^m \\right] $$\n",
    "$$ K \\equiv \\frac{n}{n-m}\\binom{n}{m}^\\frac{m}{n-m} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair potential example: Coulomb's law\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_i = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(note that more sophisticated models would include the effects of Debye Shielding and other Coulomb screening)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embedded Atom Model:\n",
    "- Each atom is considered to be embedded in a sea of electrons, and the electron density at a given point corresponds to the energy of the atoms\n",
    "- Allows the capture of bounding and repulsion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble of Configurations\n",
    "- Collection of possible conditions that the system can occupy under specific circumstances\n",
    "- For example, what therodynamic parameters do we keep constant (pressure, temperature, volume)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Ensembles:\n",
    "- Micro-canonical ensemble (const Nl, volume, energy)\n",
    "- Canonical ensemble (const N, volume, temp)\n",
    "- Isothermal-isobaric ensemble (const N, pressure, temp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary Conditions:\n",
    "- usually periodic in single or multiple dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Minimization\n",
    "- Typically systems are relaxed in order to provide most stable / energetically favorable configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-Source Models:\n",
    "- LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulator\n",
    "- GROMACS \n",
    "- more available in lecture slides"
