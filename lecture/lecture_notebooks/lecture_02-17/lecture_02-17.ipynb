    "## Parallel Programming\n",
    "### MPI\n",
    "MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a method to distribute computing across multiple processes. \n",
    "#### MPI Commands\n",
    "It includes four \"main\" commands that compactify the distribution and collection of information amongst processes (i.e., collective communication):\n",
    "\n",
    "_MPI_Gather_\n",
    "\n",
    "_MPI_Broadcast_: Broadcast a variable to all processes\n",
    "\n",
    "_MPI_Scatter_\n",
    "\n",
    "_MPI_Reduce_: Add up a variable across all processes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains for ODE / PDE integration\n",
    "A spatial domain needs to be distributed carefully. The difficulty lies with the need to communicate all \"boundary\" conditions between each subdomain. This leads to load imbalance, where the slowest process dictates the efficiency of the algorithm. Different techniques can be used to obtain effectively \"optimized\":\n",
    "- Maximize volume to surface area ratio of each subdomain $=>$ cubes\n",
    "- Ghost cells between adjacent cubes to facilitate transmission of boundary values (used in AIKEF). Important to be careful about transmitting information between cells in an efficient manner (communication is likely the bottleneck)\n",
    "- Use space-filling curves to \"fill\" domain with a connected grouping (AIKEF uses this method)\n",
    "#### Amdahl's Law\n",
    "- Consider a code that isn't completely load-balanced and has a parallel efficiency $P$:\n",
    "- $(1-P)$ is the time spent waiting on non-parallelized fraction\n",
    "- The code is run on $N$ cores\n",
    "$$ S(N) = \\frac{1}{(1-P) - \\frac{P}{N}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\implies \\lim_{N \\longrightarrow \\infty} S(N) = \\frac{1}{1-P} $$\n",
    "#### Task-based computation\n",
    "Rather than distributing an inequivalent set of computations across equal spatial domains, it is possible to arrange tasks sequentially such that each process is working on the \"next\" task that must be completed. This technique requires you to represent the problem with a directed acyclic graph (DAG; similar to the graph structure of a git repository)\n",
