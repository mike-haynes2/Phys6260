    "Increasing the parameter space dimensionality with, e.g., lot size, # of floors, conditions, zip code, etc: each of these have a different impact on the price, and the _regression_ approach of supervised learning attempts to predict the price given a set of these parameters. _Classification_ would be the alternative, a model which attempts to classify the \"type\" of house based on input parameters (not a quantitative value like a price).\n",
