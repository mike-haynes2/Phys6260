## Exercise 1(a)

**1.a)**    [Github Account](https://github.com/mike-haynes2)\
*Note that my github page is effectively just [my personal site](https://mike-haynes2.github.io/) and a couple file system backups.*


## Exercise 1(b)

**1.b)** I am familiar with Julia, Python, C++, as well as quasi-programming code 'languages' including Bash, Markdown, Mathematica, and LaTeX. I am most comfortable using Python, with c++ as a close second; however, I am not very experienced with the higher level stuff, like dynamic memory management and object oriented approaches.


## Exercise 1(c)

**1.c)** I have taken a course (Earth System Modeling, EAS6130) in numerics that focused on the analytical formulation of fundamental computational methods. We derived numerical approximations for root finding, integration and differentiation, calculated error and stability criteria, and derived methods such as RK4, upwind/downwind, and Crank-Nicholson for solving systems of ODEs and PDEs: due to the rigor of this approach, there was little time for other numerical methods like MC/DS Monte Carlo, transport equations, or any application of newer methods like neural networks. These methods are what I hope to learn at a level sufficient to understand research done with them, or hopefully even employ them myself.
