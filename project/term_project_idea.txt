Project idea for Comp Phys term project

Group: Neil, Corrine, Kenneth

Topic: 3D, (ideally distributed) MHD model

Problem: Study Magnetosheath Jets (GG work, review, etc)

Test cases:
-use specific for 1D, 2D during development
-for 3D, pickup process (inject nonuniform density and watch it evolve)
-converts smoothly into Jet scenario
